# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. This project focuses on analyzing what sorts of people were likely to survive this tragedy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and includes information such as age, sex, passenger class, and whether or not the individual survived the disaster.

## Objectives
- Explore the dataset to understand the distributions and relationships of different variables.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and prepare it for machine learning models.
- Build predictive models to determine the factors influencing survival and predict survival outcomes for new data.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python Libraries**: Utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented Random forests classification using scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing data, scaled numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: Employed cross-validation, grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and evaluated models based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing features for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Building and training machine learning models to predict survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using cross-validation and selecting the best-performing model.

## Conclusion
Through this project, valuable insights are gained into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can predict survival outcomes with reasonable accuracy based on passenger information. This project serves as a practical demonstration of data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation in a real-world context.
